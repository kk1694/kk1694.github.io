## Welcome To Krisztian's Professional Page

I'm a machine learning engineer, focusing especially on deep learning and computer vision.

Right now, I'm working at [Greyparrot.ai](https://www.greyparrot.ai/), a company focused on monitoring and automating waste recycling. During my time here, I worked on
- Training and evaluating object detectors, especially single shot Yolo (v3 & v5) type models.
- Deploying models on Nvidia Jetsons (TX2 and AGX) and writing a fast (C++) inference pipeline.
- Designing the hardware underlying the computer vision system; in particular selecting the camera, lighting, and the network connection.
- Integrating an [Automata](https://automata.tech/) robot with our API to pick items from moving conveyor belts.

I occasionally [blog](blog) about ML-related topics.

Before doing machine learning, I worked in insurance as an actuary. Feeling unchallenged, I decided to take a sabbatical. I travelled to Asia, trained in a kung fu school, meditated in a Thai monastery, and fell in love. When I came back to London, I decided to transition into ML.
